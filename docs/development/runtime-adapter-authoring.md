# Author a gateway runtime adapter

Use this guide when adding, auditing, or debugging a server-side runtime
adapter. The [gateway architecture](../design/aos-runtime-gateway-architecture.md)
is the normative authority. The [V1 design](../design/aos-runtime-gateway-v1.md)
is a dated completion record, not normative. This guide explains the obligations
that are difficult to infer from TypeScript interfaces alone.

## Start from the native runtime

Inspect the runtime's maintained SDK, client application, protocol source, and
behavior tests before designing the adapter. Record a capability and lifecycle
matrix that answers:

- Which identities are durable, and which are process- or connection-local?
- Which reads are authoritative, and which streams are incremental?
- How are turns started, observed, stopped, continued, and reconciled?
- Can a running turn be redirected or queued, and what does acknowledgement
  mean?
- How are commands, questions, approvals, tools, Todos, and content represented?
- What can be recovered after a connection or process generation changes?

Expose native behavior faithfully. An unsupported operation stays unavailable
with a reason. Do not emulate it with a different operation that merely looks
similar.

## Preserve the ownership boundary

```text
client (presentation, drafts, or any ACP v2 consumer)
        -> ACP v2 WebSocket (ACP layer) / REST (bytes/discovery)
        -> member middleware stack (empty for the operator)
        -> Channel (per-member delivery)
        -> SessionCoordinator
        -> ServerRuntime / ServerTurnEngine
        -> native adapter clients and transports
```

| Owner                | Responsibilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Client               | Presentation, local drafts, navigation, locale, accessibility, microphone capture, playback, and the client-side follow-up queue.                                                                                                                   |
| Normalized routes    | Input validation, authorized resource scope, protocol encoding, and friendly errors.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Member middleware    | Role rules as member commands and events: the guest stack scopes, refuses, and projects before anything reaches the Channel or the ACP encoder.                                                                                                     |
| Channel              | Per-member delivery for one Session's channel: subscription, cursor, followed turn, offered and delivered requests, resume and replay, and reissue of pending requests.                                                                             |
| `SessionCoordinator` | One logical execution per Session, admission, idempotency, Stop and steering serialization, turn segment identities, subscriber fanout, bounded replay, per-conversation answer collection, usage and model readings, and authoritative settlement. |
| Runtime adapter      | Native authentication, stable/native identity mapping, connection topology, Session attachment, native payload validation, capability mapping, event conversion, recovery, and retention.                                                           |
| Native runtime       | Durable Agents, Sessions, history, executions, interactions, tools, and content.                                                                                                                                                                    |

The coordinator must not learn native WebSocket methods, live Session IDs, or
provider event shapes. The adapter must not create a second turn coordinator or
browser runtime. Add a shared abstraction only after two adapters demonstrate
the same semantic requirement.

## Keep lifetimes distinct

Treat these as separate objects:

1. The durable native Session and transcript.
2. The adapter's live attachment, subscription, or process-local Session ID.
3. The coordinator's logical execution.
4. A proxy turn segment (a sequence of events with a stable `turnId`).
5. A downstream browser subscriber.

A browser disconnect releases only its subscriber. It does not stop native
work, settle the logical execution, discard a pending interaction, or close a
provider attachment still needed for recovery.

A question ends one turn segment. Answering continues the turn, while the logical execution and native Session continue.
Active-turn steering stays inside the current segment and creates no new turn.

Connection and retention topology remains provider-private. Hermes uses a
multiplexed JSON-RPC connection and durable-to-live Session attachments;
OpenClaw and OpenCode have different native observation and recovery models.
They share coordinator semantics, not a generic socket manager.

## Own the native link

Each adapter keeps one connection owner per native link, built with
`createLink` (`src/core/link.ts`). The owner dials the link,
reconnects on backoff with full jitter (`LINK_BACKOFF`: base 250 ms, cap 5 s),
and applies a circuit breaker (`LINK_BREAKER`: open after 5 consecutive failed
dials, half-open after 10 s). It stops retrying when the failure kind is
`gone` or `runtime_authentication_required`; both are terminal until the upstream
turns ready.

`Link.held()` returns `true` while the breaker holds the dials: a caller that
wants to wait for the link to come up may check it before queuing. The adapter
must call `link.dispose()` on every exit path — normal close, error, and
cancellation — so the owner stops dialing and releases any open connection.

Keep the reconnect budget (`RETRY_BUDGET`) shared across all owners of one
runtime so that N owners do not retry in lockstep after a runtime restart.

## Map native output to the gateway-owned turn vocabulary

Adapters emit the gateway-owned turn vocabulary (`TurnEvent`, `TurnEventKind`,
`PendingRequest`, `RequestReply`, `TurnInput`, `ExecutionEvent` from
`src/core/events.ts`); the ACP layer in `src/acp/`
translates them for the client. The `TurnEventKind` names
(`turn-started`, `message-chunk`, `thought-chunk`, `tool-call-*`,
`plan-updated`, `turn-requires-action`, …) follow ACP's language and are
gateway-internal; the client sees only the ACP messages they translate to.
Treat the vocabulary as an event grammar, not a bag of JSON:

- final assistant prose is a message chunk, never a thought chunk;
- reasoning starts and ends independently of final text;
- every tool call and result reaches a terminal state before the turn ends;
- turn completion carries success, a request for the operator, or cancellation
  only after the segment is complete;
- provider progress uses structured events when it is meaningful to the UI;
- Session Todos use a `plan-updated` event (`TurnEventKind.PlanUpdated`); the
  ACP layer projects them as `plan_update` with `_meta.hgw.todos`;
- restored Todo activity is presentation state and is never forwarded as
  native prompt history.

Carry every native fact the operator can use, and leave out one the provider
does not report rather than guessing it. The translator maps each to a
standard ACP field or to `_meta.hgw`:

- `ToolCallStarted.name` is always the canonical tool name, and live turns and
  history agree on it; `toolKind` comes from that name.
- Tool `locations` and `diffs` use absolute paths, with the patch as `git diff`
  text. Never emit a path the adapter's privacy rule hides.
- Timestamps are UTC ISO strings (`toISOString()`), and `durationMs` is whole
  milliseconds.
- `TurnEnded` carries `stopReason` when the provider reports one, its token
  `usage` with cache reads and writes, and the turn's `cost`. `TurnFailed`
  names the `provider` and `model` that failed.
- Partial tool output is `ToolCallOutputChunk`; command output is
  `TerminalOutput`, after its owning `ToolCallStarted`.
- Compaction is `CompactionUpdated` with a stable id: started, then completed
  with a summary, failed with an error, or cancelled when the turn ends
  without the runtime confirming it.
- `ModelChanged.modelId` is the same id `session/set_config_option` uses for
  the model option.
- Subagent work names its `subagentId`. The spawning call carries `subagent`,
  and `SubagentUpdated` reports its progress.
- Stored history carries the same tool kind, locations, diffs, timing, and
  stop reason where the provider's stored rows have them, so a reload reads
  like the live turn.

Validate native events before conversion. Reject malformed, oversized,
unknown, and wrong-Session events without disturbing other Sessions. Route by
the exact Agent and Session attachment before publishing normalized output.

History is authoritative. Incremental events make the UI timely; they do not
replace provider history during recovery.

`history(agentId, sessionId, limit, offset)` pages backwards from the newest:

- `offset` counts from the newest message, so `0` is the newest page and each
  page's `nextOffset` is where the next older page starts. Messages within a
  page stay chronological.
- A page that stops short of the Session's start begins at a turn start: its
  first user message. The older rows before it are dropped and `nextOffset`
  re-reads them as the next page's newest. A page that reached the start is
  kept whole, and so is a page with no user message, whose turn is longer
  than the page.
- Only the `offset === 0` page carries the Session's current plan and any
  restored failed turn.
- `truncated: true` says older history exists that the adapter cannot reach;
  set it on the page that reaches that limit rather than failing the read.

## Separate Send, queue, steering, and commands

These operations have different authority and retry semantics:

| Operation                | Owner                    | Meaning                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Send while idle          | Coordinator and adapter  | Admit one new native user turn.                                                    |
| Browser follow-up queue  | Assistant UI             | Retain FIFO user intent until the Session can accept it.                           |
| Active-turn steering     | Coordinator control lane | Correct the current native execution without starting another turn.                |
| Provider-queued steering | Native runtime           | The steering request was accepted for later application; do not send another copy. |
| Native command           | Adapter                  | Execute a catalog-recognized provider operation with its native result semantics.  |

Steering requires an exact active `turnId`, a unique request ID, text-only
input, and the controller's authorization. Stop and steering serialize through
the same control lane. Steering is unavailable while idle, stopping,
uncertain, or waiting for input.

Discover commands from the native catalog. A leading slash alone does not make
text a command: an unknown `/name` remains an ordinary prompt. Resolve native
aliases with a strict depth bound. Preserve distinct command outcomes:

- immediate normalized output;
- composer prefill;
- alias dispatch;
- asynchronous prompt or skill execution.

Apply native attachment and rewind restrictions to commands rather than
silently changing their semantics.

## Make Edit and Retry authoritative

The browser supplies one replacement user turn and an opaque source message
identity. The adapter must locate that identity in fresh authoritative history
and translate it to the native rewind or truncation operation.

Never use browser-supplied history as provider authority. A stopped turn that
was never persisted is not a rewind source. Repeated edits must use current
native identities; matching an older row by text can truncate the wrong
conversation. If history changed incompatibly, reconcile and return a
normalized conflict rather than guessing.

A prompt's answer names the id history stored the prompt under, so the browser
can edit it at once. The adapter proves that id through
`ServerTurnHandle.stored`, a receipt made by `storageReceipt()` in
`core/storage-receipt.ts`. Resolve it with the stored id once the native
runtime proves it, and call its `end(event)` with the terminal event on every
path a turn ends by: finish, failure, stop, and detach. A turn that ends
unproven then rejects the receipt, and the coordinator answers the prompt at
once with what happened instead of waiting out its deadline. Never derive an id
the runtime does not prove, from text or position.

## Preserve requests

Questions and approvals are normalized pending requests. The ACP layer delivers
them as `session/request_permission` or `elicitation/create` to the client.
The `_meta.hgw` extensions on these requests are defined in
`protocol/acp.ts:315-341`. The vendor permission kind `_allow_session`
(`HGW_PERMISSION_KIND_SESSION`, `protocol/acp.ts`) represents Hermes' "allow for this
session" scope; the translation lives in
`src/acp/translate/requests.ts`. Elicitation questions arrive in
`_meta.hgw.questions`; a multi-select question must declare `items.enum` in the
ACP property schema (`requests.ts`) so the SDK accepts the elicitation,
while the response schema does not constrain values to the enum.

Steps for the adapter:

1. Validate the complete native interaction batch.
2. Finish the current segment with a `turn-requires-action` outcome.
3. Preserve normalized request metadata in authoritative history.
4. Retain the native Session while it waits for input.
5. Accept one complete response with `resolved` or `cancelled` entries.
6. Continue the same logical execution (no new turn created).

An answer is not a new user prompt. Repeated identical responses may be
idempotent; conflicting, expired, wrong-Session, or incomplete responses make
no native call. Reload reconstructs the request from normalized history or
adapter-private native discovery, not from a browser polling contract.

The coordinator collects the answers per conversation
(`src/core/session-coordinator.ts:748-782`), so members in different
tabs may each answer one request of a batch. The first answer to a request
wins, and the adapter receives one complete batch of replies when the last
open request is answered.

## Design for uncertainty and reconnect

Every native mutation needs an admission identity and an acknowledgement
boundary. If a connection fails after dispatch but before acknowledgement,
return `uncertain`. Never automatically replay Send, Stop, steering, command,
rewind, or interaction responses.

Reconnect performs attachment and reconciliation:

```text
authorize scope
  -> read authoritative history and execution state
  -> recover or recreate provider observation
  -> replay safe missed events when supported
  -> reconcile identities and terminal state
  -> resume normalized delivery
```

Provider replay positions are adapter-private: the coordinator carries only the
opaque `{ epoch, lastSeen }` an adapter reports, never a provider cursor. Replay
overflow or an epoch change falls back to authoritative reads without
resubmitting user intent.

## Classify every failure

Every failure crossing the adapter boundary is one of three kinds, or a caller error
(`src/core/failures.ts`):

| Kind                              | Meaning                                                                |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gone`                            | What the request named no longer exists; nothing brings it back.       |
| `unavailable`                     | Nothing happened; the same request may succeed later.                  |
| `uncertain`                       | A write may have landed; reconcile before trying it again.             |
| `invalid_request`                 | The caller supplied a bad input; a retry would meet it again.          |
| `revision_conflict`               | A concurrent write changed the state the request assumed.              |
| `runtime_authentication_required` | The credential is absent or rejected; re-authenticate before retrying. |

A read is never uncertain: an adapter call past `ADAPTER_CALL_MS`
(`src/core/limits.ts`, 15 s) is `unavailable` for a read and
`uncertain` for a write. The native error travels as `cause` on every failure,
so the coordinator and the gateway log can include the chain without the adapter
deciding what to reveal.

Use `failureOf(kind, cause)` to construct a `PublicFailure` with the
canonical machine code for that kind. Use `publicFailure(cause, table)` when
the native error carries a code the adapter maps to a kind.

## Normalize capabilities, state, and content

Capabilities are structured values. Preserve native choices, limits, scopes,
and unavailability reasons rather than reducing operations to booleans. Cache
capabilities for the relevant scope; ordinary renders and generic Session
invalidations are not capability changes. A local draft has no Session-scoped
capabilities.

Derive `running`, `stopping`, `waiting-for-input`, and terminal state from the
coordinator and ACP lifecycle state. Use `plan-updated` events for Todos (the ACP layer
translates them to `plan_update`) and structured events for progress. Do not create polling endpoints for state already
carried by the normalized turn or history.

Parse provider-injected attachment and context envelopes server-side. Return
safe filenames, MIME types, sizes, and opaque content identities. Native paths,
filesystem warnings, credentials, URLs, payloads, and error bodies never cross
the adapter boundary, with one narrow exception: for the MCP App file route, a
native path reaches gateway core, as `agentFolder` already does, through
`ServerMcpApps.toolCall`'s input and `readFile`'s real path. Core judges it
against the configured folders and reads through `readFile`; the path still
never reaches a guest, a view, an error body, or a log line. Transcription and
speech synthesis run only after their explicit user actions and remain distinct
from native multimodal audio input or output.

## Share execution, project authorization

Operator and guest requests using the same configured upstream identity share
the same Runtime instance, coordinator, provider connection, and native
execution. Authorization controls observation and mutation; it does not create
a duplicate runtime.

Guest output is projected by the guest middleware
(`src/guest/middleware/`) before the member encoder
(`src/acp/member-encoder.ts`) writes it to the guest connection.
This keeps reasoning, raw tools, permission requests, privileged roles, native
metadata, paths, live IDs, and provider positions out of memory that an authorized guest
connection can drain. Adapters stay role-blind: they never see which member
asked. A slow or expired guest may lose its own subscriber without delaying or
stopping operator delivery.

## Implement one vertical operation

For each adapter operation:

1. Find the existing observable behavior and its provider-neutral contract.
2. Inspect the native client and payloads that implement the same behavior.
3. Add one focused conformance test that fails for the missing mapping.
4. Implement the smallest native client, validation, and conversion change.
5. Verify capability fidelity, ownership, isolation, and failure mapping.
6. Exercise reconnect or uncertainty when the operation mutates native state.
7. Run the adapter suite and the affected provider-neutral client test.

Changing shared protocol or coordinator code requires evidence that the
existing seam cannot express a real native capability. Prefer an adapter-private
mapping when the difference is connection topology, live identity, retention,
or provider recovery.

## Completion checklist

An adapter is ready when:

- its capability matrix matches inspected native behavior;
- stable identity and Session ownership are enforced on every operation;
- its event stream obeys the gateway-owned turn vocabulary ordering and rejects foreign Session events;
- Stop, steering, commands, Edit/Retry, and requests preserve native
  semantics where supported;
- lost mutation acknowledgements are uncertain and never replayed;
- reconnect restores observation and state without resending prompts;
- provider payloads and paths cannot enter normalized or guest output;
- focused adapter tests and provider-neutral conformance tests pass;
- `runServerRuntimeContract` (`src/core/runtime-contract.ts`) passes
  in the adapter's own `contract.test.ts` — this suite is the gate for the
  adapter's failure taxonomy, recovery token, and link contract;
- `runWireContract` (`src/acp/wire-contract.ts`) passes in the
  adapter's own `wire-contract.test.ts` — this suite drives the real gateway over
  the adapter's native fake via an in-memory WebSocket and proves what a plain
  ACP v2 client reads; rows the adapter cannot express are named in `gaps`.
  Each adapter's fake lives beside its source, not in a shared test helper.

When a runtime's native client is open source and the gateway's server-side
requirements (bounded decoding, credential isolation, uncertain-mutation
handling, reconciliation) can be satisfied with a thin wrapper, vendor the
upstream client files byte-identical rather than reimplementing the wire
protocol. Place the copy in a `vendor/` subdirectory, record the upstream pin,
per-file hashes, and a sync recipe in that directory's `UPSTREAM.md`, and
enforce the snapshot with a dedicated test. Keep replay ownership inside the
adapter — if the upstream client offers a replay mode, disable it and let the
adapter drive recovery from authoritative history.

Use the Hermes adapter and its tests as a worked example, not as a transport
template. Its package map is in
[`src/adapters/hermes/README.md`](../../src/adapters/hermes/README.md).

### Catalog-change subscription

Implement the optional `subscribeCatalogChanges(listener)` method on
`ServerRuntime` when the native provider broadcasts catalog-change signals.
The method returns a `Promise<() => void>` (the unsubscribe function;
`src/core/runtime.ts:258`). Hermes uses its native
`sessions.changed` WebSocket event. The ACP layer calls this method to wake
the activity feed on connect; adapters that omit it simply receive no wake.

### Turns the runtime starts by itself

Implement the optional `subscribeTurns(scope, { onTurn, onError })` method on
`ServerTurnEngine` when the native runtime can start a turn in a Session
without the gateway: a subagent result, a loop tick, a heartbeat, cron, or
another native client. A Session's channel subscribes while any client has
it resumed. The adapter only signals; the shared core adopts the turn through
`discover` and streams it to every member, who can Stop it like any other.

- Fire `onTurn` when a turn this adapter did not start begins, and again
  whenever the subscription is remade, at setup or after a reconnect or rebind,
  while such a turn is running.
- Stay silent for the adapter's own turns. A foreign turn that starts during
  one is found by the `discover` the channel runs after every turn's end.
- Fire at most once per native turn, however often the runtime announces it.
- Own reconnect retries and report failures through `onError`; never throw.
  The returned stop function may be called more than once and ends retries.
- Report provider status about the Session, during any turn or none, through
  the optional `onNotice`; notices are live only, never stored or replayed.

Because the channel calls `discover` after every turn's end, `discover` must
return `undefined` for a turn the adapter admitted, including one still
settling. It returns a running foreign turn with its events, and sets
`fromStart` only when those events begin at the native turn's first event, so
a browser following it replays the whole turn instead of receiving a reset.
Adapters that omit `subscribeTurns` behave as before: only turns the gateway started
reach other browsers.

### Agent updates: `updateAgent(agentId, patch, observedRevision)`

`updateAgent` replaces `updateAgentVisibility`. It writes `patch.visibility`
and/or `patch.avatar` in one native write, refusing a stale `observedRevision`.
`patch.avatar` is a token string or `null` to clear.

Rules for every adapter:

- **Filter before parsing.** A stored value that does not match
  `AgentAvatarSchema` (`/^[a-z0-9-]{1,32}\/[a-z0-9-]{1,32}$/`) reads as no
  icon, not as a bad row.
- **Throw `ServerAgentUpdateUnsupportedError`** for any field the runtime cannot
  store. Reject the whole patch; nothing is half-applied.
- **Enforce `avatarEditable` in the adapter.** The browser flag is informational
  only; the adapter must refuse a write for any Agent that is not writable.
- **Take expected revisions from a fresh read.** Read the Agent's current state
  at the start of `updateAgent`; do not cache revision values from `listAgents`.
- **Report `createdAt`** in `AosSessionInfoMeta` where the native Session has a
  creation timestamp. Omit it when the provider does not track one.

### Session read state and `unread`

Project `unread` in `HgwSessionInfoMeta` only when the native payload proves the
read state (for example, Hermes `last_read_at` NULL means read). Omit `unread`
when the payload is absent or ambiguous; absent never overwrites a known value in
the client. Declare the read-state capability unavailable rather than emulating
it with a synthetic value.

### Usage reporting

The gateway emits one `usage_update` on `session/new`, on `session/resume`, after
every settled turn, and after a `session/set_config_option` that changes the
model, to every member given the usage feed; guests are given none. The
coordinator owns the reading (`src/core/session-coordinator.ts`),
and the Channel reports it to a member joining the Session
(`src/core/channel.ts`). Implement
`workspaceCapabilities` to return a `SessionContextResponse`, or declare usage
unavailable; a provider that cannot answer at all leaves the last reading
standing without emitting an empty gauge.

### Published Artifacts

A published Artifact travels as the gateway-owned `artifact-published` turn event
carrying an `HgwArtifactDescriptor`
(`protocol/acp.ts`; translated in
`src/acp/translate/turn-events.ts`), or, in history, as a `data`
message part named `hgw.artifact`
(`src/acp/translate/history.ts`). Only `id`, `filename`, and
`source` are required; `source` is `inline`, `url`, or `provider` with an
opaque `reference`. The ACP layer turns either form into a `resource_link`
content block with `uri: "artifact://<id>"` on the owning turn, so a live turn
and a replayed one reach the client identically. The id must be opaque and
stable for that Agent and Session; never put a native path in it or in any
public tool argument or result.

Emit a descriptor only from an authoritative source: a harness's own native
media delivery (Hermes `MEDIA:` lines, OpenClaw `artifacts.download`), an
uploaded attachment, or a trusted native delivery tool such as Hermes
text-to-speech.
`src/adapters/hermes/media-lines.ts` (`MediaLineFilter`) strips
`MEDIA:` lines from streamed prose across deltas and replaces an unclaimed one
with `[Media unavailable]`. It is private to the Hermes adapter and parses
Hermes's own `MEDIA:` convention; it is not a general helper.

Validate every path with `src/core/artifact-path.ts` before keeping
it: `safeArtifactPath` accepts only absolute POSIX paths with no `..`
segment, no control characters, at most 4096 bytes, and no credential-like
basename (`.env*`, `auth.json`, `config.yaml`, `credentials`, and similar).
Keep the path in a private Agent-and-Session-scoped mapping.

Implement `ServerRuntime.artifact(agentId, publicSessionId, artifactId)`
(`src/core/runtime.ts`) to resolve the id only within that
Session and return `{bytes, mimeType?, filename}`, read through the harness's
own file interface and bounded by `MAX_ARTIFACT_BYTES` (25 MiB). The route
`GET .../sessions/:sessionId/artifacts/:artifactId`
(`src/routes/content.ts`) serves it on both listeners.

### MCP tool names

The `aos-ui` tools MCP server and every other MCP server
are registered with the harness by the operator, never by the gateway. Each
harness prefixes MCP tool names its own way, so pass every native tool name
through `canonicalToolName(rawName, resolve)`
(`src/core/aos-tool-names.ts`) before it enters the run vocabulary
or history:

- the four `aos-ui` tools read bare: `render_chart`, `render_map`,
  `render_stats`, `present_artifact` (`canonicalAosToolName`);
- any other MCP tool the adapter's resolver recognizes reads
  `mcp__<server>__<tool>`, built from the original server and tool names, so
  one server gives the same name on every runtime;
- an unknown name stays raw.

The resolver matches a raw name against the runtime's own MCP server list,
never by splitting the string. Hermes and OpenCode build it with
`createMcpToolNames(scheme, catalog)` (`src/mcp-apps/tool-names.ts`),
where the scheme states how the harness spells a tool: Hermes
`mcp__<sanitized>__<sanitized>` with its 64-character hash clamp, OpenCode
`<server>_<tool>` matched longest server first. OpenClaw resolves
`<server>__<tool>` against its native `tools.effective` answer
(`src/adapters/openclaw/mcp-tool-names.ts`). Each list sits in
`createMcpServerCache` (`src/core/mcp-server-cache.ts`): one
single-flight fetch per key, reused for 5 minutes; an unknown name refetches
at most once per 30 s; a failed fetch keeps the last good list, and with no
list names stay raw. Use the same resolver live and on replay.

When the harness loads MCP servers per Session rather than globally, enable
`aos-ui` in the adapter before each turn, not in shared coordinator code. The
OpenClaw adapter creates Sessions with
`toolOverrides.mcpServers["aos-ui"] = true` and, before every non-resume turn,
patches the same override onto a Session created elsewhere with a
compare-and-swap on the previous overrides
(`src/adapters/openclaw/native-schemas.ts`,
`src/adapters/openclaw/run.ts`). A failed enable fails
the turn rather than running it without the tools.

### MCP Apps

An MCP tool whose server declares a `ui://` view (`_meta.ui.resourceUri`)
renders as an App card. Implement the optional `ServerRuntime.mcpApps`
(`src/core/runtime.ts`) in the adapter's `mcp-apps.ts`:

| Method                                             | Answers                                                                            |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `observe?(scope, call)`                            | A flagged call of this Session's run as it streams: name, then input, then result. |
| `describe(scope, {toolCallId, toolName, result?})` | Whether the call's tool declares a view.                                           |
| `open(scope, toolCallId, signal?)`                 | The `McpAppView`: HTML, CSP, permissions, `prefersBorder`, tool input and result.  |
| `toolCall?(scope, toolCallId, signal?)`            | The stored call: its server, tool, and full input. Absent when unavailable.        |
| `callTool(scope, toolCallId, name, args)`          | A view's `tools/call`, limited to its own server's app-visible tools.              |
| `readResource(scope, toolCallId, uri)`             | A view's `resources/read` on its own server.                                       |
| `serverResource?(scope, server, uri, signal?)`     | A named server's `ui://` resource with no call, for a published attachment's view. |

Every method first finds the `toolCallId` in this Session's own native
history, or among the running calls `observe` heard for that Session; the
client never names a server, tool, or resource URI. An unknown or foreign call
reads as not found. A host that holds its views natively leaves `observe` out.
`serverResource` is the one exception: it names a server, the configured
viewer's, and never a call. The fallback implements it; leave it out where the
native API reads a resource only for a call, as OpenClaw's does, and a
published attachment then opens with no view.

Map the native MCP Apps API when the runtime has one (OpenClaw's
`mcp.app.view`, `mcp.app.callTool`, `mcp.app.readResource`). Otherwise build
the hook with `createMcpAppsFallback(source, client)`
(`src/mcp-apps/fallback.ts`): the adapter supplies only the server
list and the stored call, and the gateway's own Streamable HTTP client reads the
view. A view named in the stored result wins over the server's `tools/list`.
The fallback reaches only HTTP servers the gateway may connect to: without auth,
or with headers the operator configured under `mcpApps.fallback.servers`
(`src/config.ts`), where the operator
may also override the URL the gateway connects to. It is a bridge;
delete it once no adapter reaches it.

Wrap the adapter in `withMcpApps(runtime)` (`src/mcp-apps/annotate.ts`)
in its factory, before the coordinator. On the run, recover, and discover
streams the wrapper awaits `describe` (1.5 s budget) when an `mcp__` or bare
`aos-ui` tool call starts, so the client draws the view while the call runs,
and asks again with the result only for a call the start could not flag. It
does the same for `history()`, sets the `app` flag, and advertises
`content.mcpApps` in the Session capabilities. The ACP layer carries the flag
as `_meta.hgw.app` on `tool_call_update`, from the call's first update.

### readFile

Implement the optional `ServerRuntime.readFile` (`src/core/runtime.ts`)
to let an App view serve its files. It is a two-step contract:

1. **Real path:** `realPath?(scope, path, signal)` resolves every link and
   returns the real path the read will open, or `undefined` if the runtime
   cannot determine it (which refuses the read). Absent means the runtime
   enforces its own roots; for operators the folder rules then judge `path`
   alone, and guests get no files from this adapter.
2. **Stream:** `read(scope, path, options)` streams the file at `path`.

The route judges the written path and the real path against the folder rules
before any byte is read. A `read` response of 403 or 404 is forwarded to the
client as not found; any other non-2xx response, or a throw, is unavailable.

### Registration and adapter file layout

Register a new adapter as a `kind` literal in the `RuntimeSchema` discriminated
union (`src/config.ts`) and add a corresponding branch in
`src/adapters/create-runtime.ts`. The conventional per-adapter
module layout (as used by OpenCode and OpenClaw) is:

| Module              | Responsibility                                           |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `adapter.ts`        | Composes all modules into `ServerRuntime`                |
| `factory.ts`        | Entry point; builds and returns a `RuntimeInstance`      |
| `capabilities.ts`   | Maps native capabilities to normalized form              |
| `client.ts`         | Validated HTTP or RPC client for native API calls        |
| `content.ts`        | Normalizes native content types and attachment envelopes |
| `history.ts`        | Converts authoritative native history rows               |
| `interactions.ts`   | Answers native clarify/approval interactions             |
| `mcp-apps.ts`       | `ServerRuntime.mcpApps`, native or through the fallback  |
| `run.ts`            | Converts native execution frames to gateway-owned events |
| `workspace.ts`      | Agent/Session catalog and metadata                       |
| `native-schemas.ts` | Validated Zod schemas for native payloads                |

The Hermes adapter predates this layout and uses different module names for
some of these roles; see
[`src/adapters/hermes/README.md`](../../src/adapters/hermes/README.md).
