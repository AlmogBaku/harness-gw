/**
 * The artifacts this gateway published live, before Hermes saved the row that
 * grants them. An uploaded image's id reaches the browser before its user row
 * persists, and a MEDIA line's id before the assistant row does, so a read in
 * that window finds nothing in history. Publishing is the grant: the gateway saw
 * this Session deliver the path. History stays the authority for anything
 * older; the oldest entries leave once the bound is reached, long after their
 * rows persisted.
